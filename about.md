## Welcome to my blog!

<br>

As this blog is still _under construction_, let me just briefly introduce myself:
- **I am Jaein Kim who loves writing, gardening, and book reading!**
- I am currently doing my **research on NLP** under the supervision of Professor [RiChong Zhang](http://act.buaa.edu.cn/zhangrc).
- I am multilingual in Korean, Chinese and English.

I mainly post articles about my research, paper review and book review in this blog.\
For any feedbacks about my posts, please feel free to email me: [jaein@buaa.edu.cn]() / [jaeink.seoul@gmail.com]()
