## Welcome to my blog!

<br>

As this blog is still _under construction_, let me just briefly introduce myself:
- **I am Jaein Kim who loves writing, gardening, and book reading!**
- I am currently doing my **research on NLP** under the supervision of Professor [RiChong Zhang](http://act.buaa.edu.cn/zhangrc).
- I am multilingual in Korean, Chinese and English.

In this blog, I will mainly post articles about my own research, paper review and book review.\
For any feedbacks about my posts, please feel free to email me: jaein@buaa.edu.cn\
I will also add comment sections on my blog ASAP.

Thank you for your visiting :)
