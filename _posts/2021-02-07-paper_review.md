## [Paper Note] [SimplE Embedding for Link Prediction in Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.04868.pdf) (2018)
#### Authors: Seyed Mehran Kazemi, David Poole
>Keywords: NLP, Link Prediction, Embedding

### Motivation
_"Canonical Polyadic (CP) decomposition is among the first tensor factorization approaches. CP generally performs poorly for link prediction as it learns two independent embedding vectors for each entity, whereas they are really tied."_

### Contributions
- Presented a simple enhancement model of CP, **SimplE**, to allow the two embeddings of related each entity to be learned dependently.
- interpretable, fully expressive
- certain types of background knowledge can be incorporated into these embeddings through weight tying
