Civility alone isn't enough to fix what's broken.
Ethics do not mean keeping your voice down.
Ethics mean taking full and unqualified responsibility for the things you choose to do and say.

many kinds of violence

am i blameless?

We do this by focusing on what’s ethical.
Civility without solid ethical foundations, in contrast, will be as useful as a bandaid slapped over a broken bone.

Even when a person’s motives are perfectly innocent, low-level behaviors can still be harmful. They can still flatten others into abstract avatars.
Retweeting false or misleading stories, even if the point is to make fun of how stupid they are, making ironic statements that, taken out of context, look like actual examples of actual hate, and generally opening the floodgates for polluted information to flow through, is what allows apex predators to cause as much damage as they do.
 remember that what might look like an insect to one person can act like a lion to others.



what metrics should be adopted by social media platforms eager to
create better spaces for their users.

What really is incivility??? How to measure it???

Is it about respectfulness?

Google’s Toxicity algorithmi -----> Toxicity detection models

In addition, individual characteristics matter in understanding incivility.

reduce incivility.

inciviliti benefit --- fight for their autority (female, etc)

Critical work acknowledges the role of power in under-
standing incivility: Those in power can decide what is

socially normative and then label as uncivil anything that
pushes against this status quo. For example, women, and
especially women of color, have historically been framed as
uncivil when they step out of the private sphere to speak as
public figures

Who define it? -- people in power. the others need 'incivility' to fight them

Some words and phrases arguably should be prohibited
on social media, but not for the reason of preserving civility.
