_Statement: I recently started posting paper reviews in my blog for my research on NLP. 
However, I am not yet a professional researcher as well as English is not my native language so that my posts might have some incorrect descriptions.
I hope whoever reading my post understand my situation and I will be very grateful if you correct any wrong information. <3
The comment section will be added to my blog very soon!!_

_This paper is worth reading for whom wants to learn about adversial attack as a beginner. 
It contains the knowledge of general adversial attack and defense methods, as well as 
the corresponding applications on CV, NLP and other important fields of AI research.
I also find this paper easy to understand as they attached a lot of figures along with detailed explanations._
