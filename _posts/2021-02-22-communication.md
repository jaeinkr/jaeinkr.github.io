We are exposed to violent, discriminate and careless words online more often than in real life.
It is not because there are more irrational people in social media, but the characteristics of the online platforms give people 
feel more comfortable to be careless or be protected behind the anonymity. 
However, I believe that every human being naturally desires to become a better person and get respects from others.
Therefore, rather than adding more and more rule-based regulations to control people's incivility online, 
using such natures of human being might be a good solution to make a better internet environment.

Specifically, we can use "nudge" strategies which lead to making people want to show rational behavior.
As mentioned in the references, some studies have found that people tend to behave more civil when they use real names in the comment sections in social media.
Also, using reputation management systems that reward positive contributions also assists to decrease incivility. 
That being said, instead of punishing people for incivil behaviors, rewarding people for positive factors is a good alternative.

Taking Quora as an example, the users can vote others' or get votes from others on their posts or comments, and the votes directly influence theire reputation.
Also, Quora users tend to use their real names to use the reputation as sort of their ability index.
With such metrics, not only less regulations are needed for the administrators to maintain the platform environment, but also people's free speech can be protected at a reasonable point.

I do not believe it is possible to make the internet completely safe and harmless.
And I believe that the only essential solution to make it possible is educations.
However in reality, we can still make the internet environment better if we don't give up working on it.

As we are living in a era of big data, there are enormous amount of data are being accumulated which reflects people's behaviors 
online with corresponding platform's management systems.
More researches on people's uncivil behavior in online platforms with help of the big data are under way.
With more experiments and analysis of the big data, algorithms that 'nudge' people to be civil will progressively improve.
