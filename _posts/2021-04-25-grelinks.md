Planning is important, especially when you study something on your own. GRE test requires us to study with so many different books, which makes it hard for us to
make a fixed plan and stick to it.
Fortunately, Magoosh provides some different setting of plans of GRE study.
So let me start with introducing the plan provided by Magoosh.

<br>

## 1. Magoosh Study Plan (Verbal Focused)
---
I am currently following the [90-day Verbal-focused](https://magoosh.com/gre/90-day-gre-study-plan-verbal-focused/) plan.
This plan is for people who are OK with math but English is not their first language.
I have just finished the first-week plan. In the first-week plan, I had to do a lot of practices of math and little verbal practice.
I think the plan is making me get done with all the math thing real fast then focus on verbal and writing afterward.
Just within one week I've already gone through most kinds of math problems.
It seems like I will be mainly solving verbal problems from the 2nd week.

## 2. ETS Official books

[ETS official](https://www.amazon.com/Official-Super-Power-Pack-Second/dp/1260026396/ref=pd_sbs_3?pd_rd_w=rGjOG&pf_rd_p=2f278529-0216-4b0b-87bc-29d98b4b6ca6&pf_rd_r=TGZGM75ZT55QZPV44179&pd_rd_r=a7b0523b-833b-4a9e-a8d7-b0afd107bda6&pd_rd_wg=Litiw&pd_rd_i=1260026396&psc=1) books are the main study material if you follow Magoosh's plans.
You will going to read and study the material by yourself then watch videos in Magoosh to review or enhance the knowledge.

## 3. Books for Vocabulary
---
I have two books for vocabularies.
One being an unofficial book \"Voca List\" by 김성연 bought from Hackers.
The other being [능률보카 어원편](http://www.kyobobook.co.kr/product/detailViewKor.laf?mallGb=KOR&ejkGb=KOR&barcode=9791125317258). The former is a vocabulary book for GRE. 
The latter isn't specifically for GRE but I bought this book because it is about deviation of English words.
It's useful because just memorizing GRE vocabularies is very exhausting without knowing the structure and deviation of English words.

## 4. Thesauras.com

[Thesauras](https://www.thesaurus.com/) is a very famous website of synonym dictionary.
I've been using it since I started writing academic paper in English.
