_Statement: I recently started posting paper reviews in my blog for my research on NLP. 
However, I am not yet a professional researcher as well as English is not my native language so that my posts might have some incorrect descriptions.
I hope whoever reading my post understand my situation and I will be very grateful if you correct any wrong information. <3
The comment section will be added to my blog very soon!!_
